You are a world-class UI/UX designer + frontend developer specialized in premium architectural websites.
Create a fully responsive, modern, minimal, luxurious website (HTML + CSS + JS) for an architecture and landscape design studio called “Arun Kumar Landscapes.”

🎨 Design Philosophy

Think like Apple + Aesop + Architectural Digest.

Clean whitespace, elegant spacing, smooth transitions.

Light theme with soft greys (#F7F7F7), white (#FFFFFF), charcoal (#222), and muted sage green accents (#9BAEA5).

Use Montserrat or Poppins for headings, Inter or Lora for body text.

Subtle fade-in animations, no heavy or distracting effects.

All images should use placeholder URLs or unsplash links I can replace later.
